Related to [JDox Science Use Case #22](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/near-infrared-camera/nircam-example-science-programs/nircam-deep-field-imaging-with-miri-imaging-parallels).<br>\n **Data:** WST simulated NIRCam images from [JADES JWST GTO extragalactic blank field](http://fenrir.as.arizona.edu/jwstmock/).<br>\n (Williams et al. 2018) https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..236...33W.<br>\n **Tools:**  photutils, matplotlib, scipy, scikit.<br>\n **Cross-intrument:** potentially MIRI.<br>\n **Documentation:** This notebook is part of a STScI's larger [post-pipeline Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis).<br>\n \n ## Introduction\n \n This notebook uses `photutils` to detect objects/galaxies in NIRCam deep imaging.  Detections are first made in a F200W image, then isophotal photometry is obtained in all 9 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F335M, F356W, F410M, F444W). The catalog is loaded back in and some simple analysis is performed on the full catalog and on an individual galaxy.\n \n The notebook analyzes only the central 1000 x 1000 pixels (30\" x 30\") of the full JADES simulation. These cutouts have been staged at STScI with permission from the authors (Williams et al.).\n \n **NOTE:** The photometry is aperture matched, but no PSF corrections are made. For more accurate color measurements, PSF corrections should be implemented, given the large range of wavelengths (and thus PSF FWHM) spanning a factor of >4.\n \n **NOTE:** The simulated JADES images have different units (e-/s) than JWST pipeline products (MJy/sr).\n \n **NOTE:** An exposure map is missing but required to calculate flux uncertainties."
