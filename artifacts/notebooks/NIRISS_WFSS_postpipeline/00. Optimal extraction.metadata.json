  "title": "Part 0: Optimal Extraction of NIRISS WFSS Spectrum",
  "description": "**Use case:** optimal extraction of grism spectra; redshift measurement; emission-line maps.  Simplified version of [JDox Science Use Case # 33](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-example-science-programs/niriss-wfss-with-nircam-parallel-imaging-of-galaxies-in-lensing-clusters).<br>\n**Data:** JWST simulated NIRISS images from [MIRAGE](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-other-tools/mirage-data-simulator), run through the [JWST calibration pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/); galaxy cluster.<br>\n**Tools:**  specutils, astropy, pandas, emcee, lmfit, corner, h5py.<br>\n**Cross-intrument:** NIRSpec <br>\n**Documentation:** This notebook is part of a STScI's larger [post-pipeline Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis).<br>\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis notebook is 1 of 4 in a set focusing on NIRISS WFSS data:\n1. 1D optimal extraction since the JWST pipeline only provides a box extraction.  Optimal extraction improves S/N of spectra for faint sources.\n2. Combine and normalize 1D spectra.\n3. Cross correlate galaxy with template to get redshift.\n4. Spatially resolved emission line map.\n\nThis notebook will start with [post-pipeline](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-data-reduction-pipeline) products of NIRISS WFSS, 2D rectified spectra, from spec level3.\n\nOptimal extraction requires source morphology along the cross-dispersion direction, which will be retrieved from direct images taken along with WFSS observations.  Morphology along dispersion direction is also essential to infer the spectral resolution, which will be obtained using template fitting to get redshift and stellar population in notebook #3 of this set.\n\n**Note:** We here assume reduction of the 2D rectified spectrum has been performed at a decent level, i.e. there is no contaminating flux from other sources on the target 2D spectrum, and that background is already subtracted."
