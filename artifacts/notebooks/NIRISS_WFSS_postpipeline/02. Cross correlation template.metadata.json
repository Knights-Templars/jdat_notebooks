  "description": "**Use case:** optimal extraction of grism spectra; redshift measurement; emission-line maps.  Simplified version of [JDox Science Use Case # 33](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-example-science-programs/niriss-wfss-with-nircam-parallel-imaging-of-galaxies-in-lensing-clusters).<br>\n**Data:** JWST simulated NIRISS images from [MIRAGE](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-other-tools/mirage-data-simulator), run through the [JWST calibration pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/); galaxy cluster.<br>\n**Tools:**  specutils, astropy, pandas, emcee, lmfit, corner, h5py.<br>\n**Cross-intrument:** NIRSpec <br>\n**Documentation:** This notebook is part of a STScI's larger [post-pipeline Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis).<br>\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis notebook is 3 of 4 in a set focusing on NIRISS WFSS data:\n1. 1D optimal extraction since the JWST pipeline only provides a box extraction.  Optimal extraction improves S/N of spectra for faint sources.\n2. Combine and normalize 1D spectra.\n3. Cross correlate galaxy with template to get redshift.\n4. Spatially resolved emission line map.\n\nThis notebook derives the redshift of a galaxy with multiple emission lines by using specutils template correlation.  The notebook begins with optimally extracted 1D spectra from notebook #2.\n\n**Note:** Spectra without emission lines (e.g., ID 00003 in the previous notebook) may fail with the function here.  For those spectra, Notebook #4 derives the redshift from absorption lines and direct images instead."
