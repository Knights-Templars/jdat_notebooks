  "description": "**Use case:** optimal extraction of grism spectra; redshift measurement; emission-line maps.  Simplified version of [JDox Science Use Case # 33](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-example-science-programs/niriss-wfss-with-nircam-parallel-imaging-of-galaxies-in-lensing-clusters).<br>\n**Data:** JWST simulated NIRISS images from [MIRAGE](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-other-tools/mirage-data-simulator), run through the [JWST calibration pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/); galaxy cluster.<br>\n**Tools:**  specutils, astropy, pandas, emcee, lmfit, corner, h5py.<br>\n**Cross-intrument:** NIRSpec <br>\n**Documentation:** This notebook is part of a STScI's larger [post-pipeline Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis).<br>\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis notebook is 4 of 4 in a set focusing on NIRISS WFSS data:\n1. 1D optimal extraction since the JWST pipeline only provides a box extraction.  Optimal extraction improves S/N of spectra for faint sources.\n2. Combine and normalize 1D spectra.\n3. Cross correlate galaxy with template to get redshift.\n4. Spatially resolved emission line map.\n\nThis notebook obtains an emission line map from the 2D-cutout of NIRISS WFSS spectra. This notebook will require the 2D-cutout of NIRISS WFSS spectrum (e.g., l3_nis_f150w_G150C_s00004_cal.fits; Pipeline spec3 product).\n\n**Note:** For this example, the notebook uses only a 2D rectified spectra at one dither position, directly obtained from the current versionn of the  pipeline (Build 7.5), but one could start with spectra stacked with all dither positions too, to improve S/Ns."
