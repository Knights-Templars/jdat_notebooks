  "description": "This notebook demonstrates how to inspect spectra in Specviz, export spectra from the GUI in the notebook, select regions in the GUI and in the notebook, and measure the redshift of a source in the GUI. The dataset is a JWST/NIRISS simulation of a generic scene with extended sources generated with the code MIRAGE (https://mirage-data-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and run through the JWST calibration pipeline (https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\nInstallation instructions to include the latest version of specutils, the visualization tools (jdaviz), and implicitly Jupyter:\n- Create a fresh conda environment with python (conda create -n env_name python)\n- Activate environment (conda activate env_name)\n- Install latest specutils and jdaviz:\n- pip install git+https://github.com/astropy/specutils.git\n- pip install git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz.git\n\n**Author**: Camilla Pacifici, NIRISS Instrument Scientist\n\n**Updated on**: 2021/3/4"
