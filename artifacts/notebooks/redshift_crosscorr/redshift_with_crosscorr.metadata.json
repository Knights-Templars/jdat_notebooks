  "description": "This notebook attempts to follow the workflow that uses IRAF tasks, described here http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/iraf/rvsao/xcsao/xcsao.proc.html\n\nObserved spectrum from LEGA-C: LEGA-C is a galaxy survey of about 3000 galaxies at z~0.8 and M* > 10^10 M_sun in the COSMOS field. The spectra sample the rest-frame optical between ~3000A and 5000A at high resolution and very high signal-to-noise ratio. More information about the survey can be found here: http://www.mpia.de/home/legac/\n\nTemplate from Pacifici et al. 2012.\n\n**Developer Notes:**\n- This workflow will be rendered in a few simple clicks in specviz\n- Preparing the template outside the correlation function allows for applications to different science cases\n\nAuthor: Ivo Busko"
