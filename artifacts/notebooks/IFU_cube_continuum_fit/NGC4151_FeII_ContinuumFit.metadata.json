  "description": "**Use case:** continuum and emission-line modeling of AGN; 1.47-1.87um.<br>\n **Data:** [NIFS](https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/current-instruments/nifs) on Gemini; NGC 4151.<br>\n **Tools:**  specutils, jdaviz/cubeviz, astropy, matplotlib, bottleneck.<br>\n **Cross-intrument:** NIRSpec; potentially MIRI <br>\n **Documentation:** This notebook is part of a STScI's larger [post-pipeline Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis).<br>\n \n ## Introduction\n \n This notebook uses an example 3-D IFU Datacube of the Active Galactic Nucleii NGC 4151 [Storchi-Bergmann et al. 2009,  MNRAS, V 394, pp. 1148-1166](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.394.1148S/abstract).  This is a ground-based AO-fed H-band dataset (1.47-1.87um) from the Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) instrument at the Gemini Observatory.  NIFS is a very similar image slicing IFU to JWST NIRSpec.\n \n This notebook performs some simple spectral investigations.  The notebook utilizes [jdaviz/cubviz](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz) to inspect the dataset and extract 1-D spectra.  The continuum is fit in a region near to the 1.644um [Fe II] emission from the AGN outflow and subtracted.  The centrally compact atomic Hydrogen Brackett 12 feature, which is nearby in wavelength and contaminates the [Fe II] outflow emission, is also fit and removed.  The data sub-cubes of the continuum model and the isolated and continuum subtracted [Fe II] emission are then saved.  These saved data sets will ultimately serve as starting points for the future notebooks in this set.\n \n **Note:** This notebook is designed to analyze the 1.6440 [Fe II] emission but the wavelengths can be altered to fit and remove continuum around any emission line of interest.\n \n ## Imports\n  - time for timing\n  - numpy for array processing and math\n  - matplotlib.pyplot for plotting images and spectra\n  - astropy.io for reading and writing FITS cubes and images\n  - astropy.modeling for modeling spectral curves\n  - astropy.utils.data for accessing the data\n  - specutils.fitting for spectral data fitting\n  - specutils Spectrum1D for modeling emission lines\n  - jdaviz.app to use cubeviz in the notebook\n "
