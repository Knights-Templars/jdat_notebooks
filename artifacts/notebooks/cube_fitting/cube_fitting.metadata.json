Here, we demonstrate 1-D spectral modeling applied to an individual spaxel, 900 spaxels in a cube, and spectra summed over spatial regions. Analysis of large JWST spectral data cubes can be computationally expensive, depending on number of spaxels modeled and number of free model parameters. This task can be made manageable by focusing on spatial sub-regions of interest or by minimizing model complexity.  Sub-regions in the cube are selected by location and line ratios. The spaxels in these regions are then summed and modeled with a combination of continuum, emission line, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), and silicate dust features. Best-fitting model spectra are fit using the lmfit package, utilizing a Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares method. "
