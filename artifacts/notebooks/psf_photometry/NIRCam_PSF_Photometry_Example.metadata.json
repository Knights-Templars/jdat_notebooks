  "description": "**Note on pysynphot**: Data files for pysynphot are distributed separately by Calibration Reference Data System. They are expected to follow a certain directory structure under the root directory, identified by the PYSYN_CDBS environment variable that must be set prior to using this package. In the example below, the root directory is arbitrarily named /my/local/dir/trds/. \\\n export PYSYN_CDBS=/my/local/dir/trds/ \\\n See documentation [here](https://pysynphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation-and-setup) for the configuration and download of the data files."
